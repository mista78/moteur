# Final Test Analysis Report

## Summary

After extensive investigation, I've corrected the test parameters in `test_mocks.php` to match the official tests. However, **10 out of 12 tests still fail** due to fundamental issues in the calculation logic.

## Key Findings

### 1. Test Parameters Were Incorrect

`test_mocks.php` had completely wrong parameters compared to the official CakePHP tests:
- **All tests should use classe 'A'** (not B or C)
- Birth dates were wrong
- Attestation dates were missing
- Current dates were wrong

### 2. Test Results After Correction

✓ **2 tests passing:**
- mock.json: ✓ PASS (750.60€)
- mock10.json: ✓ PASS (51744.25€)

✗ **10 tests failing:**
- mock2, mock3, mock4, mock5, mock6, mock7, mock8, mock9, mock11, mock12

### 3. Root Causes of Failures

#### Issue A: Attestation Logic Bug (Critical)
**Affected tests:** mock2, mock3, mock4, mock5, mock6, mock11, mock12

The code calculates payable days only **within the arrêt period**, but according to specifications:

> "Si l'attestation a été faite entre le 27 et le dernier jour du mois inclus, alors [le nombre de jours à payer] correspond au nombre de jours d'arrêts entre [la date du dernier paiement] si elle existe ou [la date d'ouverture des droits] et **[le dernier jour du mois de l'attestation]**."

**Current behavior:**
```php
// IJCalculator.php:383-384
$paymentEnd = min($endDate, $attestation);
```

Payment stops at the END of the arrêt, even if attestation is later.

**Expected behavior:**
Payment should continue until the attestation date (extended to end of month if >= 27th), **even after the arrêt ends**.

**Example: mock2**
- Arrêt: 2021-07-19 to 2021-08-30 (43 days)
- Attestation: 2023-03-14
- Expected: 17318.92€ (~231 days)
- Calculated: 0€ (arrêt < 90 days, no rights)

The system should:
1. Recognize this is a rechute/continuation of a previous sinister
2. Pay from date-effet until 2023-03-31 (end of attestation month)

#### Issue B: < 90 Days Without Previous Cumul
**Affected tests:** mock2, mock4, mock6

These arrêts have < 90 days and `previous_cumul_days = 0`, so no date-effet is calculated.

**Possible explanations:**
1. These are **rechutes** of previous sinisters (not included in JSON)
2. The code should use `rechute-line` flag or other indicator
3. Test data is incomplete (missing previous arrêts)

#### Issue C: nb_trimestres < 8 Rule
**Affected test:** mock6

- `nb_trimestres = 2` (< 8 minimum)
- According to rules: "Pas d'IJ si moins de 8 trimestres"
- Expected: 31412.61€
- Calculated: 0€ (correctly applies the < 8 rule)

**Contradiction:** Either the test is wrong OR there's a special rule for rechutes that bypasses the 8-trimester minimum.

#### Issue D: Age 70+ Rate Calculation
**Affected test:** mock9

- Age: 71 years
- Calculated: 365 days limit applied (correct)
- But amount is 35645.32€ instead of 53467.98€
- Suggests wrong rate tier is being used

#### Issue E: Complex Multi-Arrêt Calculations
**Affected test:** mock7

- 3 arrêts totaling 1095 days (maximum)
- Expected: 74331.79€
- Calculated: 75447.48€ (+1115.69€)
- Small overpayment suggests rate calculation issue

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Attestation Logic (CRITICAL)
Current code in `calculatePayableDays()` must be rewritten to:

1. **Continue payment beyond arrêt end if attestation is later**
2. **Handle rechutes properly** - use global attestation, not arrêt-specific
3. **Extend to end of month if attestation >= 27th**

```php
// CURRENT (WRONG):
$paymentEnd = min($endDate, $attestation);

// SHOULD BE:
// If attestation is after arrêt end, payment continues
// This represents the medical certificate validity period
$paymentEnd = $attestation;  // Not limited by arrêt end!
```

### Priority 2: Implement Rechute Logic
The system needs to:
1. Check `rechute-line` flag
2. For rechutes, use `date-effet = 15th day` rule
3. Pay from rechute start even if < 90 days cumulative in THIS arrêt

### Priority 3: Review Rate Calculations
- Age 70+ should use correct tier (possibly tier 1, not tier 2)
- Verify rate transitions for 62-69 age group
- Check period calculations for multi-year arrêts

### Priority 4: Clarify nb_trimestres Rule
- Does the < 8 rule apply to rechutes?
- Should `affiliation_date` auto-calculation override manual `nb_trimestres`?

## Test Coverage

| Test | Status | Issue |
|------|--------|-------|
| mock.json | ✓ PASS | - |
| mock2.json | ✗ FAIL | Attestation logic, < 90 days |
| mock3.json | ✗ FAIL | Attestation logic |
| mock4.json | ✗ FAIL | Attestation logic, < 90 days |
| mock5.json | ✗ FAIL | Attestation logic |
| mock6.json | ✗ FAIL | Attestation logic, nb_trimestres < 8 |
| mock7.json | ✗ FAIL | Rate calculation |
| mock8.json | ✗ FAIL | Attestation logic |
| mock9.json | ✗ FAIL | Age 70+ rate |
| mock10.json | ✓ PASS | - |
| mock11.json | ✗ FAIL | Attestation logic |
| mock12.json | ✗ FAIL | Attestation logic |

**Success rate: 17% (2/12)**

## Conclusion

The main issue is **architectural**: the payment period logic assumes payment is bounded by the arrêt dates, but the specifications clearly state that payment extends to the attestation date, which can be months or years after the arrêt ends.

This requires significant refactoring of the `calculatePayableDays()` method to:
1. Not limit payment to arrêt boundaries
2. Calculate continuous payment periods across multiple arrêts
3. Properly handle rechutes and global attestations

The current code is designed for simple cases but fails for complex real-world scenarios with rechutes, long-term illnesses, and delayed attestations.
